A very destructive virus involving non-MBR related stuff. STRICTLY for educational purposes only!
src not available right now, might add it later ;)

# Important Information
 - Don't run this on your main computer unless you are a complete idiot.
 - Don't send R3KT to friends, they may not like you afterwards.
 - Run it in a VM and learn from it.
 - Use it to test defense systems.
 
 *IMPORTANT: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES, REPAIR, AND SUCH. I PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE "AS-IS". STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!
 
# Tested Operating Systems and effects (All tested in VMs)
*Windows XP
  - System unbootable after destruction.
  
*Windows 7
  - System gets past startup animation and then a BSOD appears.

# How the virus destroys the OS
R3KT iterates through all files on your system drive and replaces the contents of all files with "get r3kt.". This is done in rapid speed so WFP simply can't keep up to keep critical system files alive. It also messes up configuration files too. There is no way to fix your OS after R3KT damaged it. You may need to reinstall Windows if you ran R3KT.

- Note: If R3KT wasn't run as an administrator, your profile and anything that has your ownership on it is corrupt.

# What about Wine?
It will still have a drastic effect on Wine too. It makes your Winebottle unusable and destroys all system files and data instantly. The Z: drive (the drive that offers local file access to your computer) is intact as R3KT only affects your system drive.
